# Image_denoising
In this project we use should use the MNIST datset and add noise to it then we should train a model to denoise them.

The following things have been done in this project
- Download the MNIST dataset and create a dataloader that adds gaussian noise to the input images.
- Design and train an AutoEncoder on the MNIST dataset to denoise the noisy images.
- Visualize original images, their corresponding noisy images and their reconstructed versions side by side.
- Repeat the previous steps using PCA algorithm.
